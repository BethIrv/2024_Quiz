Welcome to the Basic Facts Quiz!!

To begin, choose which difficulty you want to play. 
You can choose between, easy, medium, and hard. 

You can then choose which operation you would like.
Your options are Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication, and a Mix.

Next, choose how many questions you would like.
Press <enter> if you want infinite questions. 

You can leave the game at any time by entering <xxx>

Try and get as many questions correct within three attempts. 

Enjoy!!
