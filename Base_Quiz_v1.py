Welcome to the Basic Facts Quiz!!

To begin, choose which difficulty you want to play. 
You can choose between, easy, medium, and hard. 

Next, choose how many questions you would like.
Press <enter> if you want infinite questions. 

You can leave the game at any time by entering <xxx>

Try and get as many questions correct within three attempts. 

Enjoy!!
